# Contributing to multiNyx

**multiNyx** is an open-source project under development at **DaedalusLAB** at the **University of Murcia**. The goal of this project is to configure a server capable of generating multimodal datasets for research in communication, linguistics, and the humanities.

Currently, the project has generated an initial output consisting of 13,000 (unbalanced) instances where a person moves their wrists and says “Yesterday,” “Today,” or “Tomorrow.” The dataset can be found on [UMUbox](https://umubox.um.es/index.php/s/S8WABezNqDDVt2C/authenticate); please contact **cpcanovas@um.es** to request access to the data.

If you're interested in learning more about multimodal research, the work being done in **multiNyx**, or if you’d like to explore ways to collaborate, feel free to reach out to us at **brian.herreno@um.es**. We welcome inquiries and connections from those who share our passion for advancing this field.

While we're not yet at a stage where we can fully support forks and debugging contributions, we encourage you to keep an eye on the project. If you have suggestions or questions, feel free to open an issue. We appreciate your interest and look forward to growing the **multiNyx** community together.
